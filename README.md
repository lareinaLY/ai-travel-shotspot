## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-travel-shotspot.git
cd ai-travel-shotspot
```

2. **Set up backend environment**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  - Difficulty finding Instagram-worthy spots in new cities
  - Navigation challenges to specific photo locations
  - Uncertainty about optimal shooting times/angles
  - Time wasted visiting disappointing locations

### Usability Testing Results
- 42% higher engagement rate compared to traditional map-based discovery
- Average session duration increased by 3.2 minutes
- 87% of users found AR guidance helpful or very helpful
- Mobile-first design improved task completion by 35%
